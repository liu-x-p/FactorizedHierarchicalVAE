Code used to in part implement Interspeech 2019 paper:

  title={{Combining Adversarial Training and Disentangled Speech Representation for Robust Zero-Resource Subword Modeling}},
  year=2019,
  booktitle={Proc. Interspeech 2019},
  pages={1093--1097},
  doi={10.21437/Interspeech.2019-1337},
  url={http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2019-1337}
}

This recipe is based on Wei-Ning Hsu's FHVAE implementation [1].
